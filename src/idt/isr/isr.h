// After preparing the IDT (an array containing ISR) we need to load the ISR's into it
// In order to implement ISR (interrupt service routine) we need to do a few things

// Each ISR is a simple and short function that does a small task
// There is a problem: we can't use inline assembly since it's risky and might corrupt the stack
// Therefore we will have a small assembly stub that pushes specific values and then calls a general ISR handling function (aka ISR_Handler)
