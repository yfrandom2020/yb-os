YB project - custom operating system

A simple operation system project as my yb project. This project contains a simple yet fully booted and functioning operating system that will have two main features: 1) File system that supports txt files as well as directories and sub directories 2) A simple chat room where two operating systems that are sitting on different machines can communicate in text messages (using the NIC)
